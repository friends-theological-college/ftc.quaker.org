<h3>Paul F. Knitter</h3>
<p>Emeritus Professor of Theology at Xavier University, in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, 
  Paul Knitter received a licentiate in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian 
  University in Rome (1966) and a doctorate from the University of Marburg, Germany 
  (1972) Most of his research and publications have dealt with religious pluralism 
  and interreligious dialogue. Since his ground-breaking 1985 book <i>No Other 
  Name? </i> he has been exploring how the religious communities of the world 
  can cooperate in promoting human and ecological well-being. This is the topic 
  of: <i>One Earth Many Religions: Multifaith Dialogue and Global Responsibility</i> 
  (1995) and <i>Jesus and the Other Names: Christian Mission and Global Responsibility</i> 
  (1996). He has recently published a critical survey of Christian approaches 
  to other religions: <i>Introducing Theologies of Religions</i> (2002). He is 
  also General Editor of Orbis Books' series &quot;Faith Meets Faith.&quot; </p>

        From 1986-2004, Knitter was on the Board of Directors for CRISPAZ (Christians 
        for Peace in El Salvador). He is also on the Board of Trustees for the 
        International, Interreligious Peace Council, formed after the 1993 World 
        Parliament of Religions, to promote interreligious peace-making projects. 
        His significant contribution of books on liberation theology, race and 
        gender issues, and peace studies formed the core of the Amani na Tumaini 
        special collection at Friends Theological College library in Kaimosi, 
        Kenya. The college is grateful to both Paul Knitter and his wife, Cathy 
        Cornell (pictured at right) for this generous gift.</p>
