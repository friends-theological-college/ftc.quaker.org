  <br>
  <a href="http://www.stpaulslimuru.ac.ke/" target="blank">St. 
  Paul's University</a>, Limuru, provides FTC students with an accredited diploma 
  through external examinations. All the coursework is done in Kaimosi at FTC, 
  but the exams are marked and moderated by St. Paul's faculty in Limuru. This 
  enables our graduates to pursue further study with less time and expense. Most 
  other colleges will now require only two additional years to complete a bachelor's 
  degree. </p>
<p><b>Corresponding Membership with ACTEA</b></p>
<p>In 2007, Friends Theological College achieved Correspondent Member status with 
  the <a href="http://www.theoledafrica.org/ACTEA/" target="blank"> Accrediting 
  Council for Theological Education in Africa</a> (ACTEA). This is an important 
  milestone on the path to full independent accreditation for FTC's Bachelor of

<p><b>Textbook program</b></p>
<p>FTC launched a new textbook program in 2003. Until then, the college had no 
  textbooks for any courses. Through a generous gift by Western Yearly Meeting, 
  FTC was able to purchase the first textbook, <i>The Christian Theology Reader</i>, by Alister McGrath. 
  Gradually other textbooks have been added to the collection; it is hoped that FTC will be able 
  to purchase a textbook for use in each course. Students borrow the textbooks 
  per term, and the library retains the books for use by future students.</p>

Programs</a></b> 
<p><br>
  <b>(1) Certificate in Pastoral Ministry</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Designed as a solid introduction to pastoral ministry for pastors at the village 
  meeting level, or evangelists, youth leaders, and USFW pastors at higher levels. 
  The certificate includes courses as follows: Introduction to Theology, Bible 
  Survey, Intro to Pastoral Ministry, Intro to Pastoral Counseling, Intro to Quakerism, 
  as well as two English courses. Students with KCSE of D+ or below enter this 
  certificate program. It can serve as a bridge to the Diploma program upon passing 
  an examination. For other students, this certificate is sufficient, and they 
  return to ministry upon completion.<br>
<i>Length of study:</i> One year</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>(2) Certificate in Pastoral Ministry (Short Course Option)</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Certificate program is also offered as a series of short courses during 
  the school holidays. Students must take six modules over two years. The program 
  is intended for those in active ministry and church leaders, but not as a bridge 
  to the diploma.<br>
  <i>Length of study:</i> Two years</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>(3) Diploma in Theology</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Designed for students with KCSE of C- or above, or those who perform well on 
  the St. Paul&#146;s SEE entrance examination, the Diploma provides a rigorous 
  theological education and intensive preparation for pastoral ministry or further 
  study.<br>
  <i>Length of study:</i> Three years</p>
<p>(<b>4) Advanced Diploma in Peacemaking and Community Development</b></p>
<p>Designed for pastors and others who already have a diploma in theology or a 
  related field. Includes coursework designed to help pastors serve as agents 
  of peace-building and community organizing in their local communities. <br>
  <i>Length of study</i>: One year. </p>
<p><b>(5) Bachelor's Degree in Theology</b></p>
<p>In 2007-2008, Friends Theological College initiated this degree program of 
  training for pastoral service or for further study. For students with a KCSE 
  C+ or higher, this is a four-year program of study. Those who already hold a 
  Diploma may qualify for the Bachelor of Theology Diploma upgrade; please consult 
  the <a href="http://ftc.quaker.org/ProgrammeofStudyFlier.pdf" target="blank">qualifications chart</a>.</p>

<b>Theological Reading &amp; Writing Sequence</b>
  <p>
  In 2003, FTC developed a new Theological Reading &amp; Writing sequence of courses 
  for diploma students. Using primary theological texts, and centering on class 
  discussion, these courses progressively develop the following skills:<br>
  <br>
  &middot; English language reading and writing ability<br>
  &middot; Critical thinking skills<br>
  &middot; Textual analysis<br>
  &middot; Basic theological literacy<br>
  &middot; Familiarity with theologians, texts, terms, and concepts<br>
  &middot; Small-group work<br>
  &middot; Summarizing</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most FTC students have stronger verbal than written English ability. In order 
  to succeed in FTC&#146;s curriculum, and in order to be effective in pastoral 
  ministry in Kenya today&#151;particularly in urban areas&#151;students must 
  strengthen their Enligh language skills. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Students join forces to make presentations on particular texts, identifying 
  key terms and concepts, and summarizing a reading. Working with primary sources, 
  students are exposed to a broad range of writers and thinkers across the centuries. 
  This sequence of courses provides a solid foundation for the diploma curriculum 
  and serves as an excellent preparation for preaching and homiletics. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to traditional pastoral activities, many Kenyans in ministry must 
  develop the ability to plan and document various sorts of projects, such as 
  working with AIDS orphans and widows. These courses are also intended to develop 
  adequate English language skills for such activities as grant-writing and reporting 
  on service projects.</p>

<b>Co-curricular Programs and Training</b>
  <p>
  At FTC, every student participates in two major co-curricular programs throughout 
  their studies:<br>
</p>
<p><b>(1) Spiritual Formation</b></p>
<p>Every Wednesday is devoted to a Retreat in Everyday Life, with prayer, reflection, 
  Bible study, and a Convocation lecture series. A faculty mentor helps students 
  identify their gifts in ministry, meeting with them in small groups for discussion 
  and sharing. The chaplain facilitates a time of prayer, sharing and Bible study 
  for non-teaching staff as well, every Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>(2) Practical Ministry</b></p>
<p>In the first two years, students are provided with an opportunity for practical 
  ministry in a local Friends church (or congregation of their own denomination). 
  Diploma students in their third year undertake an attachment for eight weeks 
  in the field. In addition, all students are required to complete two workshops: 
  in HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness, and in peace and conflict resolution skills.</p>
<p> </p>
<b>Continuing education </b>
<p>Visitors are always welcome at the college, to browse and read in the library, 
  to attend events such as convocation lectures, or to participate in the weekly 
  spiritual formation activities. Occasional workshops are offered on campus and 
  in Friends Churches throughout Kenya. To request information on current programs 
  this semester, or to request a team of faculty and students to provide continuing 
  education in your area, contact the administrative team: ftcinfo@fum.org</p>
<b>Admission requirements</b>
  <p>
  Prospective students must have a recognized calling to ministry, with at least 
  one year of service to their local church or Friends meeting. Students from 
  all denominations are considered, but Friends are given precedence. FTC encourages 
  women to apply. Students with a C- or above enter directly into the Diploma 
  program. Students with D+ or below enter a preparatory year, which culminates 
  in the St. Paul&#146;s Special Entrance Examination (SEE) and the Certificate 
  in Pastoral Ministry; qualified students may enter the diploma program in their 
  second year, or continue one more year to earn a second certificate in Basic 
  Theological Studies.</p>

  where Friends first decided in 1902 to create a mission station, near the present 
  location of the college and press. From there, the message of Jesus Christ was 
  spread by Friends throughout East Africa. Today, the Hill of Vision is a place 
  of repentance and hope for the renewal of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). 
  The first Pamphlet was written by Dr. Robert Carter and was produced in 2004.

<p>On Saturday, 3 December 2005, FTC&#146;s most recent graduates launched a new 
  organization called <b>&#147;Angaza,&#148; which means &#147;Shine&#148; in 
  Swahili</b>. The alumni chose the name to refer to the words of Christ himself:<br>
  <br>
  &#147;You are the light of the world! A city set on a hill cannot be hid. Nor 
  do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on a stand, and it gives 
  light to all in the house. Let your light so shine before all people, that they 
  may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven!&#148; 
  (Matthew 5:14-16). <br>
